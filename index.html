        <h2>Student</h2>
        <p>In my senior year at James Madison University, pursuing a major in SMAD, I bring a blend of technical skills and design sensibility. Proficient in Python, I've developed programs that not only function seamlessly but also boast intuitive user interfaces. My expertise extends to database management and generating insightful reports using Microsoft Office tools. Well-versed in UML for process flowchart diagramming, I actively engage in group projects, contributing to the strategic planning, analysis, and implementation of business functionalities in information systems. Beyond the code, I'm committed to crafting designs that prioritize user experience, ensuring both functionality and aesthetics align seamlessly. Let's collaborate to bring creative and efficient solutions to life.</p>
